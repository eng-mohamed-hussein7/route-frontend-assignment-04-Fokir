# 🎨 Fokir Website — Assignment 4

This project is part of Route Academy’s Frontend Track.  
In this task, I started working with **positioning** and **media queries** to make the layout more flexible and responsive.  
The project is a full recreation of the **Fokir portfolio website** using only **HTML & CSS**.

---

## 📋 What I Built
- Recreated all main sections of the Fokir website using `float` for layout.
- Implemented a **CSS keyframe animation** in the hero section (home) — bonus challenge!
- Used **Font Awesome** and **icofont** icons across the design.
- Added **media queries** for basic responsiveness.
- Applied a dark transparent overlay on the hero section using `rgba()` and positioning.
